The Image11::map function in renderer/d3d/d3d11/Image11.cpp in libANGLE, as used in Google Chrome before 46.0.2490.71, mishandles mapping failures after device-lost events, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid read or write) or possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors involving a removed device.
