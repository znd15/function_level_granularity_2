Description
The ucnv_io_getConverterName function in common/ucnv_io.cpp in International Components for Unicode (ICU), as used in Google Chrome before 44.0.2403.89, mishandles converter names with initial x- substrings, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (read of uninitialized memory) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted file.
