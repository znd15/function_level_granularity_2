Description
The BasicJsonStringifier::SerializeJSArray function in json-stringifier.h in the JSON stringifier in Google V8, as used in Google Chrome before 47.0.2526.73, improperly loads array elements, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds memory access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted JavaScript code.
